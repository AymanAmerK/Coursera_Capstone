# Navigating Istanbul's Hospitality Landscape: Integrating Hotel and Airbnb Data to Enhance the Tourist Experience

Introduction
Istanbul is a vibrant city that seamlessly blends the majestic essence of the East with the modernity of the West, attracting over 15 million foreign visitors in 2019. Accommodation plays a crucial role in the overall travel experience, as tourists often spend significant time searching for the best options, whether staying in hotels or renting apartments through platforms like Airbnb. The choice of accommodation not only depends on the budget but also on the convenience and proximity to historical and entertainment sites.
Business Problem
This project aims to accelerate the decision-making process for tourists by providing a comprehensive overview of the accommodation options in Istanbul. By integrating data from Foursquare (for hotel locations and nearby venues) and Airbnb (for rental prices and locations), the project seeks to empower tourists to make more informed decisions when planning their stay in the city.

Objectives

Gather and integrate data from Foursquare and Airbnb to create a unified dataset of accommodation options and their surrounding amenities in Istanbul.
Analyze the distribution of hotels and Airbnb rentals across different neighborhoods in Istanbul, identifying the most popular and tourist-friendly areas.
Cluster the neighborhoods based on the types of venues and amenities available, providing insights into the character and offerings of different parts of the city.
Visualize the data on interactive maps, allowing users to explore the accommodation options and their surrounding features.
Provide recommendations to tourists on the most suitable neighborhoods and accommodation types based on their preferences and budget.

Data Sources and Methodology
The project utilizes two primary data sources:

Foursquare Location Data: This data is used to retrieve the names and locations of hotels in Istanbul, as well as the most common venues (e.g., restaurants, cafes, museums) in each neighborhood.
Airbnb Data for Istanbul: This data provides information on Airbnb rental prices, locations, and other relevant details.

The methodology involves the following steps:

Scrape the Foursquare data to obtain the hotel locations and nearby venues for each neighborhood in Istanbul.
Integrate the Airbnb data to add rental information, including prices and coordinates, to the dataset.
Analyze the distribution and clustering of hotels and Airbnb rentals across different neighborhoods, identifying the most popular and tourist-friendly areas.
Visualize the data on interactive maps, allowing users to explore the accommodation options and their surrounding features.
Provide recommendations to tourists on the most suitable neighborhoods and accommodation types based on their preferences and budget.

Expected Outcomes
By completing this project, we aim to provide tourists with a comprehensive and user-friendly platform to explore and compare accommodation options in Istanbul. The insights derived from the data integration and analysis will help tourists make more informed decisions, leading to a more enjoyable and tailored travel experience.
